<h1>Summary of me :)</h1>

<p>I’m 21 years old and currently studying graphic design at George Brown College. I’ve always had a passion for creativity, which is why I chose this path—graphic design allows me to bring ideas to life visually. Outside of school, I’m an avid soccer and hockey fan, and I love being active. Sports have taught me teamwork, discipline, and how to stay focused under pressure, which I believe also helps me with my studies. Balancing my academic work with my interests in sports keeps me motivated and energized. I’m excited to see where my graphic design journey takes me, and I’m always looking for new ways to improve my skills and push my creativity further. Whether I’m working on a design project or playing a game, I approach everything with a positive mindset and a strong drive to succeed.</p>
