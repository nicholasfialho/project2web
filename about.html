      <h1>About my designs</h1>


      <p>
        As a graphic design student at George Brown College, my work reflects a deep passion for creativity, visual storytelling, and problem-solving. I focus on blending strong design principles with modern aesthetics to communicate ideas effectively. My projects often explore various aspects of design, including branding, digital media, and print design, allowing me to experiment with different styles and techniques. I enjoy challenging myself to think outside the box, finding innovative solutions to design problems while maintaining a clear focus on the message and purpose behind each project. Through my coursework, I have developed a solid foundation in design software like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, and I continually seek to expand my skills. Outside of my studies, I draw inspiration from my love of soccer and hockey, which influence my work ethic, attention to detail, and ability to collaborate. Iâ€™m excited to continue growing as a designer and apply my skills in the professional world.</p>
